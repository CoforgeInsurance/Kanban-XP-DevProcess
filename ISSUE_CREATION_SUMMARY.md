### ðŸŸ¡ Waiting on Dependencies (67 issues)
All other issues are blocked by prerequisites as defined in the dependency map.

## Automation

### Auto-Assignment Workflow
The `.github/workflows/auto-assign-copilot.yml` workflow will automatically:
1. Detect when a PR merges
2. Extract completed issue number from PR
3. Check dependency map
4. Auto-assign newly unblocked issues to Copilot

### Example Cascade:
- When PR #8 merges (#7 complete) â†’ Auto-assign #23 (Domain Interfaces)
- When #23 merges â†’ Auto-assign #24, #25 (Value Objects, EF Configs)
- When #25 merges â†’ Auto-assign #26, #27 (Migrations, Repositories)
- And so on...

## Next Human Actions Required

1. **Review Active PRs**: Check the 6 PRs Copilot has created
2. **Merge PR #8** (Solution Structure): This will unlock the cascade
3. **Assign Content Issues**: Manually assign #19-#22 to Copilot (parallel-safe)
4. **Monitor Workflow**: Watch the auto-assignment workflow trigger

## Metrics

- **Total Issues**: 85
- **Currently Assigned**: 6
- **Ready to Assign**: 4
- **Waiting (Blocked)**: 67
- **Completed**: 0
- **Estimated Timeline**: 18 weeks (9 two-week sprints)
- **Parallelization Potential**: Up to 6 tasks concurrently in some phases
