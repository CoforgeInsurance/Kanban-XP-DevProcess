Kanban + XP + Lean development process template with GitHub Copilot SWE agent optimization for BDD/TDD workflows

A production-ready template implementing **Kanban + XP + Lean** methodologies with **BDD/TDD** workflows, optimized for **GitHub Copilot** and GitHub's native tooling.

## 🎯 What is This?

This repository provides a complete development process framework that combines:

- **Kanban** for flow-based work management
- **XP (Extreme Programming)** for technical excellence
- **Lean** for waste elimination
- **BDD/TDD** for quality-first development
- **GitHub Copilot** optimization for AI-assisted development

Perfect for teams who want to move fast while maintaining high quality.

## ✨ Features

### 📋 Issue Templates
- **Feature Request**: User stories with BDD scenarios (Gherkin format)
- **Bug Report**: Structured reproduction steps
- **Technical Debt**: Refactoring and improvements

All templates optimized for GitHub Copilot SWE agent assignment!

### 🤖 Automated Workflows
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing on every push
- **Issue Automation**: Auto-labeling, acceptance criteria checking
- **PR Automation**: Size analysis, test coverage verification
- **Copilot Integration**: Automatic review reminders

### 📖 Comprehensive Documentation
- [Development Process Guide](./DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md): Complete methodology
- [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md): How to work with this process
- Pull Request Template: Ensures quality submissions

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Create GitHub Project Board

```
Columns: Backlog → Ready → In Progress → Review → Done
```

**Setup**:
1. Go to your repository → Projects → New Project
2. Choose "Board" layout
3. Add columns as above
4. Add custom fields:
   - Priority (High/Medium/Low)
   - Size (XS/S/M/L/XL)
   - Feature Area (dropdown)

### 2. Configure Branch Protection

**Settings → Branches → Add rule for `main`**:
- ✅ Require pull request reviews (1 minimum)
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
- ✅ Require conversation resolution
- ✅ Include administrators

### 3. Enable GitHub Copilot

**Settings → Code & automation → Copilot**:
- ✅ Enable Copilot
- ✅ Allow Copilot PR reviews
- ✅ Enable Copilot suggestions

### 4. Create Your First Issue

Use the **Feature Request** template:

```markdown
## User Story
As a developer
I want to set up the development environment
So that I can start contributing

## Acceptance Criteria
Scenario: Developer sets up environment
  Given I have cloned the repository
  When I run the setup script
  Then all dependencies are installed
  And tests pass successfully
```

## 📊 How It Works

### Kanban Flow

```
┌──────────┐    ┌───────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌────────┐    ┌──────┐
│ Backlog  │ -> │ Ready │ -> │ In Progress │ -> │ Review │ -> │ Done │
└──────────┘    └───────┘    └─────────────┘    └────────┘    └──────┘
                               WIP Limit: 1-2
```

### TDD/BDD Cycle

```
1. Write Test (Red)  →  2. Make Pass (Green)  →  3. Refactor
         ↑                                               │
         └───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### GitHub Copilot Integration

```
Issue with clear criteria
         ↓
Assign to @github-copilot
         ↓
Copilot creates PR
         ↓
Human review & merge
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

### Issue Writing (for Copilot)
✅ **DO**:
- Include specific file paths
- Define clear acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)
- Mention related functions/classes
- Specify test framework
- Keep issues small (< 1 day)

❌ **DON'T**:
- Write vague requirements
- Create large, multi-day issues
- Skip acceptance criteria
- Forget technical hints

### Pull Requests
- **XS/S** (< 250 lines): ⭐ Ideal
- **M** (250-500 lines): ✅ Acceptable
- **L/XL** (> 500 lines): ⚠️ Split it up!

### WIP Limits
- Individual: **1-2 issues** max
- Team: **3-5 issues** in progress
- Respect limits to maintain flow

## 🛠️ Workflows Included

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline (`ci.yml`)
- Runs tests on every push/PR
- Configurable for multiple languages
- Ensures code quality

### 2. Issue Automation (`issue-automation.yml`)
- Auto-labels issues by content
- Checks for acceptance criteria
- Guides Copilot assignment

### 3. PR Automation (`pr-automation.yml`)
- Auto-labels by changed files
- Analyzes PR size
- Verifies test coverage

### 4. Dependabot (`dependabot.yml`)
- Weekly dependency updates
- Automated security patches
